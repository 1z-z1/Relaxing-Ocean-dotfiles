# dotfiles for Arch Linux Openbox Desktop Version 1.0

# Relaxing Ocean
Designing this desktop was a great experience in pulling together the last few years of working within Linux and becoming more savy with working at a development level rather than a user level. The last Linux desktop that I had that was close to this level of completeness was erased due to a speedy 'dd' command while writing an iso to an SD card. RIP.
