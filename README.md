# Relaxing Ocean dotfiles

Designing this desktop was a great experience in pulling together the skills from last few years of working within Linux and becoming more savy with working at a development-level with design rather than a user-level. The last Linux desktop that I had that was close to this level of completeness was erased due to a speedy 'dd' command while writing an iso to an SD card. RIP.

The future has more in store:)

-Polybar is in the config directory and requires the `Iosevka` + `Icomoon-feather` fonts.
-Put all files in `/home/$USER/.config/polybar/` and add the fonts to your system. 
 Then execute `launch.sh` to start the polybar or add this script to your WM startup file.
