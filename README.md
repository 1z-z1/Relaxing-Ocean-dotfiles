# Relaxing Ocean dotfiles

Designing this desktop was a great experience in pulling together the skills from last few years of working within Linux and becoming more savy with working at a development-level with design rather than a user-level. The last Linux desktop that I had that was close to this level of completeness was erased due to a speedy 'dd' command while writing an iso to an SD card. RIP.

The future has more in store:)
